| **Wireless Pentest**        | Assessing wireless network security                       | Depends on wireless setup: Guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2-Enterprise |
| **Physical Pentest & Social Engineering** | Assessing physical security and human factor | Depends on **task goals**, includes **tailgating**, badge cloning, phishing |

### 🔧 Other Types of Assessments
- **Mobile Penetration Testing**
- **IoT Penetration Testing**
- **Red Team Engagements** (Mimic real adversary to test detection and response)
- **Purple Team Engagements** (Red + Blue team collaboration for mutual improvement)

## 📝 Report Writing

- Communicate findings to both **technical** and **non-technical** audiences
- Split the report:
  - **Executive Summary**: High-level overview, impact, and business risk
  - **Technical Details**: Step-by-step vulnerabilities, tools used, evidence
- Recommendations should:
  - Be **clear and actionable**
  - Include **remediation steps** and **risk level**
  - Prioritize based on **impact and likelihood**

## 🎤 Debriefing

- A **walkthrough session** of the report with stakeholders
- Highlight key risks, answer questions, provide **clarity** on methodology and findings
- Reinforce importance of **fixing critical issues first**

> 💡 **Tip**: Always ensure assessments align with the organization's scope and permissions. Never go beyond the boundaries set in the **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**.
