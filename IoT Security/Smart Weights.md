## üìò Abstract

MuscleMind Metrics is a smart gym equipment solution designed to enhance physical training by tracking repetitions, sets, rest intervals, and performance metrics using embedded sensors and Bluetooth-enabled communication. It incorporates key principles of IoT security to ensure the reliability, integrity, and privacy of fitness data.

## üß† Problem Statement

Most gym-goers lose track of repetitions and sets. According to studies, over 30% overestimate their physical activity. Traditional tracking is cumbersome and error-prone. Our goal was to build an **IoT-enabled dumbbell** that:
- Tracks reps and movement using accelerometers.
- Connects to smartphones using Bluetooth.
- Charges wirelessly.
- Implements robust security practices for safe use.
