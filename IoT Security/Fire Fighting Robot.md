# Project Overview

## üìå Project Title:
**Dual-Barreled Fire Fighting Robot Using Arduino**

## üß† Project Idea:
This project addresses the risk faced by human firefighters by developing a **low-cost, autonomous firefighting robot prototype**. The robot is capable of **detecting and extinguishing fires automatically**, making it useful in hazardous environments where human intervention is unsafe or delayed.

The system combines **infrared flame sensors, motor control, and water pump actuation** to identify fire sources and respond swiftly. It is a multidisciplinary project incorporating elements of **mechanical design, electronics, embedded systems, and automation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Design and Architecture:

### üîÑ Mode of Operation:
- **Automatic Mode**: Robot detects fire using IR sensors and moves toward it to extinguish.
- **Manual Mode** (Optional/Scalable): Can be extended using RF or remote control for direct human operation.

### üß± Modules:

1. **Fire Detection (IR Sensors):**
   - Three infrared flame sensors placed at 180¬∞ for wide-angle detection.
   - Detect IR radiation emitted by fire and trigger response.

2. **Motion & Navigation:**
   - **L293D Motor Driver Module** to control DC motors and robot movement.
   - **Chassis with wheels** for mobility toward the fire source.

3. **Fire Suppression Mechanism:**
   - **Dual-barrel water pump system** increases water flow rate for faster extinguishing.
   - **Servo motor (SG90)** used to rotate the barrel toward fire direction.

4. **Microcontroller:**
   - **Arduino Uno** ‚Äì central processing unit that reads sensor input, controls motors and actuators.
