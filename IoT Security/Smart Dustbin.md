# 🗑️ Smart Dustbin Using IoT – Project Overview

## 📌 Project Title:
**IoT-Based Smart Garbage Monitoring and Notification System**

## 🧠 Project Idea:
The **Smart Dustbin** is an IoT-based system developed to address inefficiencies in traditional waste management. The goal is to automate **garbage level detection** and send **real-time notifications** to the concerned authorities when the bin is nearly full.

The project integrates **sensor-based automation** with **cloud communication** to reduce manual checks, prevent overflowing, and improve urban cleanliness as part of **smart city initiatives**.

## ⚙️ System Design and Architecture:

### 🔄 Mode of Operation:
- **Human Detection Module**: Detects the presence of a person using **sound or foot tap**, triggering automatic lid opening.
- **Garbage Level Detection**: Continuously measures waste level using **ultrasonic sensor**.
- **Cloud Notification System**: When the bin is full, an alert is sent to the **municipal dashboard** or admin.

### 🧱 Modules:

1. **Input Sensors**:
   - **Sound Sensor**: Detects tap/clap to open lid.
   - **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures garbage height inside the bin.

2. **Processing Unit**:
   - **Arduino Uno** – Collects sensor data, processes logic, and triggers lid mechanism.

3. **Communication**:
   - **Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)** – Sends fill level data to a web interface (IoTGrecko used as platform).

4. **Actuation and Power**:
   - **Motorized Lid**: Opens and closes based on sensor triggers.
   - **Power Supply**: Connected via rectifiers and regulated to Arduino.
